## How to run scrapers?
In the case of beautiful soup and scrapy it is enough to run the program using any IDE that supports .py files. Programs were tested in Spyder environment and that's why this program is recommended to test created scripts. 
As far as selenium is concerned, apart from placing the script in a folder, you should have the Mozilla Firefox browser installed on your computer and download special software geckodriver.exe (available at: https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases). Then just specify the path to geckodriver.exe in the sel.py file and run the script

There is also a data analysis.py script in the project, where you must first set the path to the scratched data and run the program. It is also important to have all the libraries used in the programs installed, i.e. beatiful soup, scrapy, selenium, urllib, pandas, matplotlib
